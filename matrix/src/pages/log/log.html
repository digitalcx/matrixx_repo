    13.04. In the event any portion of this Agreement shall be deemed by a court of
    competent jurisdiction to be overly broad in scope, duration or area of applicability, the
    court, considering the same, shall have the power and is hereby authorized and
    directed to limit such provision so it is no longer overly broad and to enforce the same
    as so limited. Subject to the foregoing sentence, in the event any provision of this
    Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
    invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision and shall not
    affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
    13.05. LICENSEE shall comply with all applicable Federal, state and local laws and
    regulations in connection with its activities conducted pursuant to this Agreement.
    13.06. The captions and section numbers used in this Agreement are inserted only as a
    matter of convenience and do not define, limit, explain or modify the scope or intent of
    such sections or otherwise affect this Agreement.
    13.07. This Agreement and the inventorship and ownership of any inventions, patents,
    products and other intellectual property rights relating to the subject matter(s) of this 
    12
    Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
    laws of the State of Maryland and the United States of America. LICENSEE consents to
    the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the District of
    Maryland or, if federal jurisdiction is lacking, the Circuit Court of the State of Maryland.
    LICENSEE further agrees to waive its right to assert that either forum lacks personal
    jurisdiction over LICENSEE or is an inconvenient forum for resolving the underlying
    dispute.
    13.08. Any term, provision or condition required for the interpretation of this Agreement
    or which is necessary for the full observation and performance by each party hereto of
    all rights and obligations arising prior to the date of termination shall survive such
    termination.
    13.09. This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between the parties
    and all other prior negotiations, representations, agreements and understandings are
    superseded hereby.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their duly authorized
    representatives to execute this Agreement.
